## Special rules

There are a few rules, that may seem as bugs at first. However, they are intended behavior to make using the application easier.

1. **Eraser:** Once an eraser touches any object, you cannot neither edit it, not move it.
2. **Filler:** Fillers are not allowed to paint over objects. If you have an object whose border and infill are the same, clicking on the infill will only change its infill's color, not the border's.
3. **Thickness:** Thickness values are limited to the range of `<2; 10>`.
4. **Objects' properties**: When editing an object, its color, line type (except for circles) and alignment for rectangles is adapted to currently chosen values.
